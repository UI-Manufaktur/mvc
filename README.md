**Model-View-Controller (MVC)** is a powerful architectural pattern used in software development to organize code and separate concerns.

**Model**:

- The **model** represents the **data** and **business logic** of the application.
- It encapsulates the data, performs operations on it, and notifies the **view** of any changes.
- In some implementations, the model also includes the applicationâ€™s **business rules**.
- Think of it as the **backbone** of the application, managing data integrity and state.

**View**:

- The **view** is responsible for **presenting** the data to the user.
- It displays information from the model and handles user interactions (such as input or UI events).
- Views can be graphical interfaces (like web pages or mobile app screens) or even textual representations.
- Views are **passive**â€”they donâ€™t directly modify the data; they only display it.

**Controller**:

- The **controller** acts as the **mediator** between the model and the view.
- It receives user input from the view (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
- Based on this input, the controller interacts with the model (e.g., updating data) and updates the view accordingly.
- Controllers contain application-specific **logic** and handle user actions.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC separates data management, presentation, and control flow.
- **Flexibility**: Changes in one component (e.g., UI redesign) donâ€™t affect the others.
- **Reusability**: Each component can be reused independently.
- **Scalability**: Large applications benefit from the modular structure.

**Examples**:

- **Web Applications**: In web development, the controller handles HTTP requests, the model manages data (e.g., database queries), and the view generates HTML pages.
- **Desktop Applications**: GUI frameworks often follow MVC (e.g., Java Swing, .NET WinForms).
- **Mobile Apps**: Similar principles apply to mobile development (e.g., Android, iOS).
